Skype with Tim Cupp - 20160613
==============================

He'll send:
-----------
[√] Paper that claims volume change in surrounding cells
[√] A confocal dataset he has with him.
[X] Later on he will send more datasets + explanations
[!] He can potentially send worms for us to shove into the Bessel Lattice

They are interested in:
-----------------------
[√] Cell volume of E-cells and surrounding cells.
[√] Actin and Myosin particle tracking, PIV and flow quantification
	[√] Measuring 'slippage' -- the amount of myesin flow that comes without apical constriction
	[√] zyxin -- candidate protein essential for the constriction 'clutch'
